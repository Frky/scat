/* A red-black tree is a binary tree where every node is colored black or
   red such that
   1. The root is black.
   2. No red node has a red parent.
      Or equivalently: No red node has a red child.
   3. All paths from the root down to any NULL endpoint contain the same
      number of black nodes.
   Let's call this the "black-height" bh of the tree.  It follows that every
   such path contains exactly bh black and between 0 and bh red nodes.  (The
   extreme cases are a path containing only black nodes, and a path colored
   alternately black-red-black-red-...-black-red.)  The height of the tree
   therefore is >= bh, <= 2*bh.
