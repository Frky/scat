/* Change the ownership and mode bits of a directory.  If FD is
   nonnegative, it should be a file descriptor associated with the
   directory; close it before returning.  DIR is the name of the
   directory.

   If MKDIR_MODE is not (mode_t) -1, mkdir (DIR, MKDIR_MODE) has just
   been executed successfully with umask zero, so DIR should be a
   directory (not a symbolic link).

   First, set the file's owner to OWNER and group to GROUP, but leave
   the owner alone if OWNER is (uid_t) -1, and similarly for GROUP.

   Then, set the file's mode bits to MODE, except preserve any of the
   bits that correspond to zero bits in MODE_BITS.  In other words,
   MODE_BITS is a mask that specifies which of the file's mode bits
   should be set or cleared.  MODE should be a subset of MODE_BITS,
   which in turn should be a subset of CHMOD_MODE_BITS.

   This implementation assumes the current umask is zero.

   Return 0 if successful, -1 (setting errno) otherwise.  Unsuccessful
   calls may do the chown but not the chmod.  */
