  /* Verify that the privileges have really been dropped.
     This verification is here for security reasons.  Doesn't matter if it
     takes a couple of system calls.
     On Solaris (which has saved uids and gids but no getresuid, getresgid
     functions), we could read /proc/<pid>/cred and verify the saved uid and
     gid found there. But it's not clear to me when to interpret the file as a
     'prcred_t' and when as a 'prcred32_t'.
     <http://www.usenix.org/events/sec02/full_papers/chen/chen.pdf>
     section 8.1.3 also recommends to use a setreuid call as a probe, but
     this call would unexpectedly succeed (and the verification thus fail)
     on Linux if the process has the CAP_SETUID capability.
     When the verification fails, it indicates that we need to use different
     API in the code above. Therefore 'abort ()', not 'return -1'.  */
