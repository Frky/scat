     convert these to clock ticks.  Older POSIX uses CLK_TCK to
     indicate the number of clock ticks per second while modern POSIX
     uses sysconf(_SC_CLK_TCK).  Mingw32 does not appear to have
     sysconf(_SC_CLK_TCK), but appears to have CLK_TCK = 1000 so we
     use it.  Note that CLOCKS_PER_SEC constant does not apply here,
     it is for use with the clock function.  */
