     - AIX has /dev/ptc.
     - HP-UX 10..11, IRIX 6.5, OSF/1 5.1, Solaris 2.6..9, Cygwin 1.5
       have /dev/ptmx.
     - HP-UX 10..11 also has /dev/ptym/clone, but this should not be needed.
     - OpenBSD 4.9 has /dev/ptm and the PTMGET ioctl.
     - Minix 3.1.8 have a list of pseudo-terminal devices in /dev.
