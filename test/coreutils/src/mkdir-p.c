/* Ensure that the directory DIR exists.

   WD is the working directory, as in savewd.c.

   If MAKE_ANCESTOR is not null, create any ancestor directories that
   don't already exist, by invoking MAKE_ANCESTOR (DIR, ANCESTOR, OPTIONS).
   This function should return zero if successful, -1 (setting errno)
   otherwise.  In this case, DIR may be modified by storing '\0' bytes
   into it, to access the ancestor directories, and this modification
   is retained on return if the ancestor directories could not be
   created.

   Create DIR as a new directory, using mkdir with permissions MODE;
   here, MODE is affected by the umask in the usual way.  It is also
   OK if MAKE_ANCESTOR is not null and a directory DIR already exists.

   Call ANNOUNCE (DIR, OPTIONS) just after successfully making DIR,
   even if some of the following actions fail.

   Set DIR's owner to OWNER and group to GROUP, but leave the owner
   alone if OWNER is (uid_t) -1, and similarly for GROUP.

   Set DIR's mode bits to MODE, except preserve any of the bits that
   correspond to zero bits in MODE_BITS.  In other words, MODE_BITS is
   a mask that specifies which of DIR's mode bits should be set or
   cleared.  Changing the mode in this way is necessary if DIR already
   existed, if MODE and MODE_BITS specify non-permissions bits like
   S_ISUID, or if MODE and MODE_BITS specify permissions bits that are
   masked out by the umask.  MODE_BITS should be a subset of
   CHMOD_MODE_BITS.

   However, if PRESERVE_EXISTING is true and DIR already exists,
   do not attempt to set DIR's ownership and file mode bits.

   Return true if DIR exists as a directory with the proper ownership
   and file mode bits when done, or if a child process has been
   dispatched to do the real work (though the child process may not
   have finished yet -- it is the caller's responsibility to handle
   this).  Report a diagnostic and return false on failure, storing
   '\0' into *DIR if an ancestor directory had problems.  */
