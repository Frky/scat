     argument, if provided, is typically any member of the
     supplementary groups, and not necessarily the effective gid.  So,
     the most likely duplicates are the first element with an
     arbitrary other element, or pair-wise duplication between the
     first and second elements returned by getgroups.  It is possible
     that this O(n) pass will not remove all duplicates, but it is not
     worth the effort to slow down to an O(n log n) algorithm that
     sorts the array in place, nor the extra memory needed for
     duplicate removal via an O(n) hash-table.  Hence, this function
